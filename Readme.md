This is only meant to be run locally, and not as a full website. The heatmaps are generated
using Heatmap.js (http://www.patrick-wied.at/static/heatmapjs/) and maps are drawn in a
HTML5 canvas with OpenLayers (http://openlayers.org/).


Notes on use:
    Any file uploaded through the drop box must be located in the same directory as index.html.
    This is because the FileDirectories specification has not been implemented in Firefox or 
    Google Chrome(unless ran as a browser plugin). There could be obvious improvements to this project, but again its only for
    internal use. Feel free to use this as an example to build off of.
